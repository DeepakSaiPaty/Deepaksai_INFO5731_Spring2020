223,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.2,"I never had any stomach trouble, or cramps, or anything people have mentioned here."
224,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.3,People mentioned Celebrex.
225,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.4,A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex.
226,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.5,I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years.
227,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.6,Would I rather not take it?
228,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.7,"Of course, but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning."
229,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.8,"I have blood work done every year to see if there's any kidney, liver damage or anything, and so far there hasn't been any."
230,ARTHROTEC.40.txt.9,I would recommend it.
231,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.0,"Dizziness, sickness, stomach gas, feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest."
232,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.1,"Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too, I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry."
233,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.2,I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with.
234,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.3,I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try.
235,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.4,I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful.
236,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.5,"Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy."
237,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.6,"It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it."
238,ARTHROTEC.41.txt.7,I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug.
239,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.0,"Stomach pains, chest pains, anxiety, fatigue, headache, erratic heart beat, raised blood pressure, dizziness, nausea (even when taken with food), blurred vision."
240,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.1,I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills).
241,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.2,This was a solution my doctor came up with.
242,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.3,"I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication."
243,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.4,"The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps."
244,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.5,"I was at work, so I just had to brush it off."
245,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.6,It continued each time I took it.
246,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.7,"After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start)."
247,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.8,"So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it."
248,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.9,"On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs."
249,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.10,I literally thought I was dying.
250,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.11,It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day.

252,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.13,I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work.
253,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.14,A friend at work had to call an ambulance.
254,ARTHROTEC.42.txt.15,I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them.
255,ARTHROTEC.43.txt.0,"Random severe cramping, diarrhea, increased menstrual blood flow."
256,ARTHROTEC.43.txt.1,"The day I took my first Arthrotec, I started experiencing urinary incontinence."
257,ARTHROTEC.43.txt.2,It's not severe but enough to be disruptive and require a pad.
258,ARTHROTEC.43.txt.3,I haven't seen this listed in anyone's symptomology.
259,ARTHROTEC.43.txt.4,Has anyone else had this experience?.
260,ARTHROTEC.44.txt.0,"This medicine helped with the heel spurs, however the side effects were far worse and not worth taking the medicine."

264,ARTHROTEC.45.txt.2,"However the symptoms persisted, GP said "" just flu jab"" - but after 4 weeks!"
265,ARTHROTEC.45.txt.3,"Noticed today after leaving Artrotec off for a day or so ,that things were much better until I took one dose."

269,ARTHROTEC.47.txt.0,"after taking just one dose, had hunger feeling and stomach cramping, in the eve and through the night constant muscle cramps in my calf muscles, couldn't sleep, had to keep jumping out of bed because of the cramps."
270,ARTHROTEC.47.txt.1,"I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why this prescribed."
271,ARTHROTEC.47.txt.2,"Seems to me we always have to choose lesser of the 2 evils, I can't deal with Charlie Horses, so I am stopping this med."
272,ARTHROTEC.48.txt.0,I cannot believe the immediate difference this medication had made in my life.
273,ARTHROTEC.48.txt.1,I could not get up from my desk without holding onto the desk and walking up the stairs was intolerable.
